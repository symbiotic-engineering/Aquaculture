# Data Files Folder

This folder contains all necessary data files for the Python handler and model including rasters of oceanic conditions, vectors of potential conflicts, and a vector file with the included state and federal waters.

Due to space limitations on GitHub, these files are hosted externally on Zenodo and must be downloaded separately. The current files can be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) and placed in this directory with the following paths:
