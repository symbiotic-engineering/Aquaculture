# Aquaculture
This repository contains an "Marine spatial planning of offshore aquaculture with co-located wave energy", simulated through Python.

## File Structure
This repository consists of the following files:
- modules: scripts and functions to define "Wave-powered Aquaculture" optimization problem.
- objects: scripts and functions to define aquaculture and wave energy converter objects and their parameters.
- optimization: scripts and functions to perform a single objective optimization using brute-force.
- env_bruteforce: script to perform brute-force for defined net pen parmeters.
- run_sim_env: top-level script to perform the "marine spatial planning" optimization code using default values for defined environment with rasters and vectors of data.
- Gabe ???
- requirements.txt: list of the required libraries.

## How to use
In order to run the "Marine spatial planning" optimization code and find optimal location for wave-powered aquaculture farm (WPAF) for constant net pen within the Northeast U.S., you can open and run the run_sim_env (.ipynb) file.

## Dependencies
Python 3.8.8 is used to develop this package. 
For other required libraries, please refer to requirements.txt file.

## Context
The project is part of research in the Symbiotic Engineering Analysis (SEA) Lab and has been submitted to the Oceans 2023.
