# Aquaculture
This repository contains an "Optimization of offshore aquaculture with co-located wave energy", simulated through Python.
This repository consists of the following files:
- modules
- objects
- optimization
- run_sim_wec&pen
- run_sim_wec&pen_random_init
- run_sim_env
- param_sweep

Sensitivity Analysis: In order to run the "sensitivity analysis", you can open and run the param_sweep (.ipynb) file.

In order to run the "Wave-powered Aquaculture" optimization code and find optimal wave energy convereter (WEC) and optimal pen considering constant environmental parameters, you can open and run the run_sim_wec&pen (.ipynb) file.

In order to run the "Wave-powered Aquaculture" optimization code and find optimal environment considering constant WEC and pen parameters, you can open and run the run_sim_env (.ipynb) file.

In order to run the "Wave-powered Aquaculture" optimization code and find optimal WEC and optimal pen with random inputs to check the convergence of the optimization, you can open and run the run_sim_wec&pen_random_init (.ipynb) file.
